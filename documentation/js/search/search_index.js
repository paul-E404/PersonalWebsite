Datenschutz auf einen Blick        Allgemeine Hinweise        Die folgenden Hinweise geben einen einfachen Überblick darüber, was mit Ihren personenbezogenen            Daten passiert, wenn Sie diese Website besuchen. Personenbezogene Daten sind alle Daten, mit denen Sie            persönlich identifiziert werden können. Ausführliche Informationen zum Thema Datenschutz            entnehmen Sie unserer unter diesem Text aufgeführten Datenschutzerklärung.        Datenerfassung auf dieser Website        Wer ist verantwortlich für die Datenerfassung auf dieser Website?        Die Datenverarbeitung auf dieser Website erfolgt durch den Websitebetreiber. Dessen Kontaktdaten können            Sie dem Abschnitt „Hinweis zur Verantwortlichen Stelle“ in dieser Datenschutzerklärung            entnehmen.        Wie erfassen wir Ihre Daten?        Ihre Daten werden zum einen dadurch erhoben, dass Sie uns diese mitteilen. Hierbei kann es sich z. B. um            Daten handeln, die Sie in ein Kontaktformular eingeben.        Andere Daten werden automatisch oder nach Ihrer Einwilligung beim Besuch der Website durch unsere IT-Systeme            erfasst. Das sind vor allem technische Daten (z. B. Internetbrowser, Betriebssystem oder Uhrzeit des            Seitenaufrufs). Die Erfassung dieser Daten erfolgt automatisch, sobald Sie diese Website betreten.        Wofür nutzen wir Ihre Daten?        Ein Teil der Daten wird erhoben, um eine fehlerfreie Bereitstellung der Website zu gewährleisten. Andere            Daten können zur Analyse Ihres Nutzerverhaltens verwendet werden.        Welche Rechte haben Sie bezüglich Ihrer Daten?        Sie haben jederzeit das Recht, unentgeltlich Auskunft über Herkunft, Empfänger und Zweck Ihrer            gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten zu erhalten. Sie haben außerdem ein Recht, die Berichtigung oder            Löschung dieser Daten zu verlangen. Wenn Sie eine Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung erteilt haben,            können Sie diese Einwilligung jederzeit für die Zukunft widerrufen. Außerdem haben Sie das            Recht, unter bestimmten Umständen die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten            zu verlangen. Des Weiteren steht Ihnen ein Beschwerderecht bei der zuständigen Aufsichtsbehörde            zu.        Hierzu sowie zu weiteren Fragen zum Thema Datenschutz können Sie sich jederzeit an uns wenden.        Analyse-Tools und Tools von Dritt­anbietern        Beim Besuch dieser Website kann Ihr Surf-Verhalten statistisch ausgewertet werden. Das geschieht vor allem            mit sogenannten Analyseprogrammen.        Detaillierte Informationen zu diesen Analyseprogrammen finden Sie in der folgenden Datenschutzerklärung.                2. Allgemeine Hinweise und Pflicht­informationen        Datenschutz        Die Betreiber dieser Seiten nehmen den Schutz Ihrer persönlichen Daten sehr ernst. Wir behandeln Ihre            personenbezogenen Daten vertraulich und entsprechend den gesetzlichen Datenschutzvorschriften sowie dieser            Datenschutzerklärung.        Wenn Sie diese Website benutzen, werden verschiedene personenbezogene Daten erhoben. Personenbezogene Daten            sind Daten, mit denen Sie persönlich identifiziert werden können. Die vorliegende            Datenschutzerklärung erläutert, welche Daten wir erheben und wofür wir sie nutzen. Sie            erläutert auch, wie und zu welchem Zweck das geschieht.        Wir weisen darauf hin, dass die Datenübertragung im Internet (z. B. bei der Kommunikation per            E-Mail) Sicherheitslücken aufweisen kann. Ein lückenloser Schutz der Daten vor dem Zugriff durch            Dritte ist nicht möglich.        Hinweis zur verantwortlichen Stelle        Die verantwortliche Stelle für die Datenverarbeitung auf dieser Website ist:        Paul Engerling            Baldurstraße 9            90461 Nürnberg        Telefon: 015206166911            E-Mail: paul_engerling@web.de        Verantwortliche Stelle ist die natürliche oder juristische Person, die allein oder gemeinsam mit anderen            über die Zwecke und Mittel der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten (z. B. Namen,            E-Mail-Adressen o. Ä.) entscheidet.        Speicherdauer        Soweit innerhalb dieser Datenschutzerklärung keine speziellere Speicherdauer genannt wurde, verbleiben            Ihre personenbezogenen Daten bei uns, bis der Zweck für die Datenverarbeitung entfällt. Wenn Sie            ein berechtigtes Löschersuchen geltend machen oder eine Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung widerrufen,            werden Ihre Daten gelöscht, sofern wir keine anderen rechtlich zulässigen Gründe für die            Speicherung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten haben (z. B. steuer- oder handelsrechtliche            Aufbewahrungsfristen); im letztgenannten Fall erfolgt die Löschung nach Fortfall dieser Gründe.                Hinweis zur Datenweitergabe in die USA und sonstige Drittstaaten        Wir verwenden unter anderem Tools von Unternehmen mit Sitz in den USA oder sonstigen datenschutzrechtlich            nicht sicheren Drittstaaten. Wenn diese Tools aktiv sind, können Ihre personenbezogene Daten in diese            Drittstaaten übertragen und dort verarbeitet werden. Wir weisen darauf hin, dass in diesen Ländern            kein mit der EU vergleichbares Datenschutzniveau garantiert werden kann. Beispielsweise sind US-Unternehmen            dazu verpflichtet, personenbezogene Daten an Sicherheitsbehörden herauszugeben, ohne dass Sie als            Betroffener hiergegen gerichtlich vorgehen könnten. Es kann daher nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass            US-Behörden (z. B. Geheimdienste) Ihre auf US-Servern befindlichen Daten zu            Überwachungszwecken verarbeiten, auswerten und dauerhaft speichern. Wir haben auf diese            Verarbeitungstätigkeiten keinen Einfluss.        Widerruf Ihrer Einwilligung zur Datenverarbeitung        Viele Datenverarbeitungsvorgänge sind nur mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Einwilligung möglich. Sie            können eine bereits erteilte Einwilligung jederzeit widerrufen. Die Rechtmäßigkeit der bis            zum Widerruf erfolgten Datenverarbeitung bleibt vom Widerruf unberührt.        Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Datenerhebung in besonderen Fällen sowie gegen Direktwerbung (Art. 21            DSGVO)        WENN DIE DATENVERARBEITUNG AUF GRUNDLAGE VON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E ODER F DSGVO ERFOLGT, HABEN SIE JEDERZEIT            DAS RECHT, AUS GRÜNDEN, DIE SICH AUS IHRER BESONDEREN SITUATION ERGEBEN, GEGEN DIE VERARBEITUNG IHRER            PERSONENBEZOGENEN DATEN WIDERSPRUCH EINZULEGEN; DIES GILT AUCH FÜR EIN AUF DIESE BESTIMMUNGEN            GESTÜTZTES PROFILING. DIE JEWEILIGE RECHTSGRUNDLAGE, AUF DENEN EINE VERARBEITUNG BERUHT, ENTNEHMEN SIE            DIESER DATENSCHUTZERKLÄRUNG. WENN SIE WIDERSPRUCH EINLEGEN, WERDEN WIR IHRE BETROFFENEN            PERSONENBEZOGENEN DATEN NICHT MEHR VERARBEITEN, ES SEI DENN, WIR KÖNNEN ZWINGENDE SCHUTZWÜRDIGE            GRÜNDE FÜR DIE VERARBEITUNG NACHWEISEN, DIE IHRE INTERESSEN, RECHTE UND FREIHEITEN ÜBERWIEGEN            ODER DIE VERARBEITUNG DIENT DER GELTENDMACHUNG, AUSÜBUNG ODER VERTEIDIGUNG VON RECHTSANSPRÜCHEN            (WIDERSPRUCH NACH ART. 21 ABS. 1 DSGVO).        WERDEN IHRE PERSONENBEZOGENEN DATEN VERARBEITET, UM DIREKTWERBUNG ZU BETREIBEN, SO HABEN SIE DAS RECHT,            JEDERZEIT WIDERSPRUCH GEGEN DIE VERARBEITUNG SIE BETREFFENDER PERSONENBEZOGENER DATEN ZUM ZWECKE DERARTIGER            WERBUNG EINZULEGEN; DIES GILT AUCH FÜR DAS PROFILING, SOWEIT ES MIT SOLCHER DIREKTWERBUNG IN VERBINDUNG            STEHT. WENN SIE WIDERSPRECHEN, WERDEN IHRE PERSONENBEZOGENEN DATEN ANSCHLIESSEND NICHT MEHR ZUM ZWECKE DER            DIREKTWERBUNG VERWENDET (WIDERSPRUCH NACH ART. 21 ABS. 2 DSGVO).        Beschwerde­recht bei der zuständigen Aufsichts­behörde        Im Falle von Verstößen gegen die DSGVO steht den Betroffenen ein Beschwerderecht bei einer            Aufsichtsbehörde, insbesondere in dem Mitgliedstaat ihres gewöhnlichen Aufenthalts, ihres            Arbeitsplatzes oder des Orts des mutmaßlichen Verstoßes zu. Das Beschwerderecht besteht            unbeschadet anderweitiger verwaltungsrechtlicher oder gerichtlicher Rechtsbehelfe.        Recht auf Daten­übertrag­barkeit        Sie haben das Recht, Daten, die wir auf Grundlage Ihrer Einwilligung oder in Erfüllung eines Vertrags            automatisiert verarbeiten, an sich oder an einen Dritten in einem gängigen, maschinenlesbaren Format            aushändigen zu lassen. Sofern Sie die direkte Übertragung der Daten an einen anderen            Verantwortlichen verlangen, erfolgt dies nur, soweit es technisch machbar ist.        Auskunft, Löschung und Berichtigung        Sie haben im Rahmen der geltenden gesetzlichen Bestimmungen jederzeit das Recht auf unentgeltliche Auskunft            über Ihre gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten, deren Herkunft und Empfänger und den Zweck der            Datenverarbeitung und ggf. ein Recht auf Berichtigung oder Löschung dieser Daten. Hierzu sowie zu            weiteren Fragen zum Thema personenbezogene Daten können Sie sich jederzeit an uns wenden.        Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung        Sie haben das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.            Hierzu können Sie sich jederzeit an uns wenden. Das Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung            besteht in folgenden Fällen:                    Wenn Sie die Richtigkeit Ihrer bei uns gespeicherten personenbezogenen Daten bestreiten, benötigen                wir in der Regel Zeit, um dies zu überprüfen. Für die Dauer der Prüfung haben Sie                das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.            Wenn die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten unrechtmäßig geschah/geschieht,                können Sie statt der Löschung die Einschränkung der Datenverarbeitung verlangen.            Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr benötigen, Sie sie jedoch zur Ausübung,                Verteidigung oder Geltendmachung von Rechtsansprüchen benötigen, haben Sie das Recht, statt                der Löschung die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu verlangen.                        Wenn Sie einen Widerspruch nach Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO eingelegt haben, muss eine Abwägung zwischen                Ihren und unseren Interessen vorgenommen werden. Solange noch nicht feststeht, wessen Interessen                überwiegen, haben Sie das Recht, die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen                Daten zu verlangen.                Wenn Sie die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten eingeschränkt haben, dürfen diese Daten            – von ihrer Speicherung abgesehen – nur mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder zur Geltendmachung,            Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen oder zum Schutz der Rechte einer anderen            natürlichen oder juristischen Person oder aus Gründen eines wichtigen öffentlichen Interesses            der Europäischen Union oder eines Mitgliedstaats verarbeitet werden.        3. Datenerfassung auf dieser Website        Kontaktformular        Wenn Sie uns per Kontaktformular Anfragen zukommen lassen, werden Ihre Angaben aus dem Anfrageformular            inklusive der von Ihnen dort angegebenen Kontaktdaten zwecks Bearbeitung der Anfrage und für den Fall            von Anschlussfragen bei uns gespeichert. Diese Daten geben wir nicht ohne Ihre Einwilligung weiter.        Die Verarbeitung dieser Daten erfolgt auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO, sofern Ihre Anfrage mit            der Erfüllung eines Vertrags zusammenhängt oder zur Durchführung vorvertraglicher            Maßnahmen erforderlich ist. In allen übrigen Fällen beruht die Verarbeitung auf unserem            berechtigten Interesse an der effektiven Bearbeitung der an uns gerichteten Anfragen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f            DSGVO) oder auf Ihrer Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) sofern diese abgefragt wurde.

Zwingende gesetzliche            Bestimmungen – insbesondere Aufbewahrungsfristen – bleiben unberührt.        Anfrage per E-Mail, Telefon oder Telefax        Wenn Sie uns per E-Mail, Telefon oder Telefax kontaktieren, wird Ihre Anfrage inklusive aller daraus            hervorgehenden personenbezogenen Daten (Name, Anfrage) zum Zwecke der Bearbeitung Ihres Anliegens bei uns            gespeichert und verarbeitet. Diese Daten geben wir nicht ohne Ihre Einwilligung weiter.        Die Verarbeitung dieser Daten erfolgt auf Grundlage von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO, sofern Ihre Anfrage mit            der Erfüllung eines Vertrags zusammenhängt oder zur Durchführung vorvertraglicher            Maßnahmen erforderlich ist. In allen übrigen Fällen beruht die Verarbeitung auf unserem            berechtigten Interesse an der effektiven Bearbeitung der an uns gerichteten Anfragen (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f            DSGVO) oder auf Ihrer Einwilligung (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO) sofern diese abgefragt wurde.

Zwingende            gesetzliche Bestimmungen – insbesondere gesetzliche Aufbewahrungsfristen – bleiben            unberührt.        4.
